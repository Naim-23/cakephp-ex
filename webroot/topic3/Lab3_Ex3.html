          <p1 class="para1"> Hello! My name is Naim and I was born and raised in London. If you haven't heard of
          London, you must be living under a rock! It's the capital of England!
        <br /> </p1>

        <br>
          <p1 class="para1">Hmmm so what to say about London. First thing is that it's the home of her Royal Highness!
          However, if I am going to be honest with you, I'm not the biggest fan of them
          because let's be real (they're pretty much just a tourist attraction).
          MI6, if you are reading this, I did not mean it, I apologise. Please forgive me.
          <br /> </p1>

          <br>
            <p1 class="para1">What else is there in London? We have quite a few attractions down in central London, I live
            in East London, for example you have the London Eye. However, I've never been on it because
            I am terrified of heights and I mean that with my whole heart. I was scared looking down from the
            second floor of the secondary school however I have been on the cables cars, twice in fact. Strange indeed...
            <br /> </p1>

            <br>
              <p2 class="para2">I've never lived anywhere else apart from London. I've been on holiday a couple of times but I've
              never LIVED somewhere else before. London is my home and it has been for 19 years. It can be kind of dangerous sometimes
              with crime but this place is still my home. I would say it's probably the most diverse city in the country which is really nice.
              <br /> </p2>

                <br>
                  <p2 class="para2">Would I live somewhere other than London? That is a good question. Maybe in the future, I would move somewhere else but right now?
                  I couldn't imagine living somewhere else. If i were to move? Maybe Dubai? I've been there 3 times and I enoyed staying there
                  all 3 times, it's really fun there and do you want to know the best thing? Mcdonalds is halal! POG! Sadly in London, as far as I know, there
                  are no halal Mcdonalds which is quite sad but I can still eat the fillet burgers from there and their chips. A specialty of London you ask?
                  Well, fish and chips maybe?
                  <br /> </p2>

                  <br>
                    <p2 class="para2">I guess this is my final paragraph. We have come a long way. London. My home city. Now that I think about it, London
                    doesn't rhyme with anything? I think at least. Wow that's a little fun fact, I guess I may be wrong so I guess it can't
                    really be called a fact. Did you know that London is also the home of Queen Mary? Haha, you probably did already know that. Hah...
                    Okay I will be signing off now, as they say in London, pip pip cheerio!
                    <br /> </p2>
