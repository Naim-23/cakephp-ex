<br>
<br>
          <p>My name is Naim Uddin and I am currently studying at Queen Mary University of London. I am in the computer science course.</p>
            <p> I have been playing games since I was only six years old and I have been engrossed to them ever since, I am now nineteen. This just highlights how powerful the gaming industry can be to me. With this burning passion, I wanted to be a part of this industry when I am older which is why I chose computer science as my course to study as I believe it will help me reach my end goal.</p>
              <p>I do a lot of writing and reading on the side as this help improves creativity but also, I just really enjoy it. I think this also helps me with my programming because in programming, I believe you need to come up with creative ways to complete your task.</p>
